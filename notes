TheoremQuest -- A game where logicians battle for prestige by deriving and controlling powerful theorems.


Notes:

General Play:

A player's status is a measure of:
  - the number of theorems a player controls
  - and the importance of the theorems, i.e. how many other theorem depend on it.

A player may capture control of another player's theorem
by proving the theorem in a few number of lemmas.

Each time a player invokes an inference rule, a new theorem is generated.
If the theorem is a new discovery, the theorem is added to the library of knowledge
and the player gains control of the theorem.  If the theorem already
exists in the library of knowledge, but was been proven with few lemmas,
control of the theorem is transferred to the player.


User Interface:
  Front page: news, tutorials, user login.
  User dashboard: status, news related to theorems of interest (developed, refined, lost, etc.).
  User project: chalkboard (strategy planning), workspaces (windows of term editors, etc.)
